# NFLDataAnalysis

Utilizing a Jupyter notebook and data from the 2021 NFL season, I observed correlations
between how many touchdowns and total yards certain players had and how high/low their teams' offensive lines ranked.
I also recorded how many wins their respective teams had last season and how high/low their defensive lines ranked. 
All of this was done while demonstrating how to combine SQL and Python together.
